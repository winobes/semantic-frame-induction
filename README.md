# Plan!

## Stage 1

- Derive EM for model 0 (as in the Rooth paper)
- Get the data ready for this (verbargs from google n-gram)
- implement the EM
- testing our implementation
    - use some measures (e.g. DiceSim to framenet)
    - maybe try to find Gold Standard data
    - compare to other semantic frame induction (Ivan's, CMU?)
    - find areas of improvement

## Stage 2 

- adapt the model
- repeat steps in stage 1
